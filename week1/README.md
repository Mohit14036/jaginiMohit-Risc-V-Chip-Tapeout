# RTL Design & Synthesis Workshop with Sky130

This repository hosts how I have learned RTL design using Verilog, simulating digital circuits, performing synthesis, and optimizing designs for better performance. The course leverages open-source tools and the **SkyWater 130nm (Sky130) PDK**.

---

## Overview


- Write synthesizable **Verilog RTL code**
- Simulate circuits using **Icarus Verilog** and analyze waveforms in **GTKWave**
- Perform synthesis and gate-level mapping with **Yosys**
- Understand digital design fundamentals such as **testbenches, D flip-flops, timing libraries**, and **optimization techniques**
- Gain practical experience through step-by-step lab exercises

---

## Requirements


- Basic knowledge of **digital logic circuits** (AND/OR gates, flip-flops, multiplexers)
- Familiarity with **Linux commands**
- A Linux environment, or **WSL** on Windows/macOS
- Installed tools:
  - `git`
  - `iverilog`
  - `gtkwave`
  - `yosys`
  - Any text editor (VSCode, gedit, nano, etc.)

## Workshop Organization

The workshop is divided into multiple days, each focusing on a specific area of RTL design and synthesis:

| Day | Topic |
|-----|-------|
| [Day 1](Day_1/README.md) | Getting Started: Verilog RTL, Testbenches, and Simulation |
| [Day 2](Day_2/README.md) | Timing Libraries, Synthesis Strategies, and Efficient Flip-Flops |
| [Day 3](Day_3/README.md) | Optimization Techniques for Combinational & Sequential Logic |
| [Day 4](Day_4/README.md) | Gate-Level Simulation, Blocking vs Non-Blocking Assignments, and RTL-Synthesis Mismatches |
| [Day 5](Day_5/README.md) | Advanced Synthesis Optimizations: If-Else, Loops, Generate Blocks, and Ripple Carry Adders |

Each day includes:

- Concept explanations with examples
- Hands-on labs with code snippets
- Screenshots of simulations and synthesis results
- Practical tips for clean and synthesizable RTL coding
