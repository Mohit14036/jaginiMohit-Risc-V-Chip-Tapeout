# Chip Modeling and ASIC Design Flow (o0–o4)

## Abstraction Levels

- **o0 – GCC Executable**
  - Compiled software model.
  - Validates algorithms and test workloads.
  - Very fast, but not cycle-accurate.

- **o1 – C Spec Model (Golden Reference)**
  - High-level functional model in C/C++.
  - Defines intended chip behavior.
  - Used as the reference for RTL verification.

- **o2 – RTL Model**
  - Hardware description in Verilog/SystemVerilog/VHDL.
  - Cycle-accurate and synthesizable.
  - Used for simulation, synthesis, and formal verification.

- **o3 – SoC Integration**
  - RTL integrated into a full system-on-chip.
  - Includes CPU, memory, accelerators, interconnects.
  - Verified using hardware/software co-simulation.

- **o4 – Peripherals**
  - Peripheral IP blocks (UART, SPI, I²C, DMA, DDR, timers, GPIO, etc.).
  - Often third-party IP, connected via standard buses (AXI, AHB, APB).
  - Enables real-world system connectivity.

## Design and Verification Flow

1. **C Testbench**
   - Early validation against the C spec model.
   - Provides inputs and expected outputs.
   - Reusable across RTL and SoC levels with adapters.

2. **RTL Design & Verification**
   - RTL implementation checked against C model.
   - Simulation, coverage analysis, and regression testing.

3. **SoC Design & Integration**
   - Integrate CPU cores, memory, accelerators, and IP blocks.
   - Validate protocols, performance, and software execution.

4. **ASIC Synthesis (RTL2GDS)**
   - RTL → Gate-level netlist using standard-cell libraries.
   - Flow includes:
     - Logic synthesis  
     - Floorplanning  
     - Placement  
     - Clock Tree Synthesis (CTS)  
     - Routing  
     - Static Timing Analysis (STA)  
     - Power & signal integrity checks  

5. **Physical Signoff**
   - **DRC (Design Rule Check):** ensures layout follows foundry rules.  
   - **LVS (Layout vs. Schematic):** ensures layout matches logical netlist.  

6. **Tapeout & Fabrication**
   - GDSII database sent to foundry.
   - Photomasks generated and used in lithography.
   - Chip fabricated, diced, packaged, and tested with Automated Test Equipment (ATE).

## Equivalence Principle

At each stage, outputs must match to guarantee functional correctness:

- **o0 = o1** → Software execution vs. spec.  
- **o1 = o2** → Spec vs. RTL.  
- **o2 = o3** → RTL vs. SoC integration.  
- **o3 = o4** → SoC + peripherals vs. intended system behavior.  

**Final rule:**  
`o1 = o2 = o3 = o4`  
→ The design remains consistent from high-level spec down to the final SoC with peripherals.
